# FastAPI-Development
Build a RESTful API using FastAPI for a hypothetical book review system.

---

## Code Walkthrough

**Imports:** The code starts by importing necessary modules and functions from various libraries like FastAPI for building APIs, SQLAlchemy for database operations, and some custom modules (database and schemas).

**Database Setup:** It defines functions to interact with the database. `get_db()` sets up a database session, `create_book()` and `create_review()` are for adding new entries to the database, `get_books()` and `get_reviews()` are for fetching books and reviews, `get_book()` retrieves a single book, and `delete_book()` and `delete_review()` are for deleting entries.

**Endpoints:** Here, various endpoints are defined for different operations:

- Adding a Book: It accepts a POST request to add a new book.
- Submitting a Review: This endpoint allows users to submit a review for a particular book. It also includes a background task to send a confirmation email asynchronously.
- Getting a List of Books: It handles GET requests to fetch a list of books. Users can filter the list by author or publication year.
- Getting Book Reviews: This endpoint retrieves all the reviews for a given book.
- Updating Book Details: It allows updating details of a book using a PUT request.
- Deleting a Book: Handles DELETE requests to remove a book from the database.
- Deleting a Review: Allows deleting a review using its ID.

**Background Task:** There's a background task `send_confirmation_email()` that simulates sending a confirmation email for a review. This task is added when a review is submitted, and it runs asynchronously.
