# FastAPI-Development
Build a RESTful API using FastAPI for a hypothetical book review system.

## Code Walkthrough

**Imports:** The code starts by importing necessary modules and functions from various libraries like FastAPI for building APIs, SQLAlchemy for database operations, and some custom modules (database and schemas).

**Testing:** After importing the required modules, it's essential to ensure that all imports are successful by running the application and testing its functionality. Testing can be done manually or using automated testing tools like Postman.

**Database Setup:** It defines functions to interact with the database. `get_db()` sets up a database session, `create_book()` and `create_review()` are for adding new entries to the database, `get_books()` and `get_reviews()` are for fetching books and reviews, `get_book()` retrieves a single book, and `delete_book()` and `delete_review()` are for deleting entries.

**Endpoints:** Here, various endpoints are defined for different operations:

- Adding a Book: It accepts a POST request to add a new book.
- Submitting a Review: This endpoint allows users to submit a review for a particular book. It also includes a background task to send a confirmation email asynchronously.
- Getting a List of Books: It handles GET requests to fetch a list of books. Users can filter the list by author or publication year.
- Getting Book Reviews: This endpoint retrieves all the reviews for a given book.
- Updating Book Details: It allows updating details of a book using a PUT request.
- Deleting a Book: Handles DELETE requests to remove a book from the database.
- Deleting a Review: Allows deleting a review using its ID.

**Background Task:** There's a background task `send_confirmation_email()` that simulates sending a confirmation email for a review. This task is added when a review is submitted, and it runs asynchronously.

## Test Client

**Imports:** The code starts by importing the `TestClient` class from the `fastapi.testclient` module and the `app` instance from the `main.py` file. These imports are necessary for setting up the test client and accessing the FastAPI application for testing.

**Instantiating Test Client:** The `TestClient` class is instantiated with the `app` instance, creating a client object that can be used to make requests to the FastAPI application during testing.

**Test Functions:** Each test function corresponds to a specific endpoint in the FastAPI application and follows a similar structure:
- **Sending Requests:** The test function sends a request to a specific endpoint using the client object. For example, `client.post("/books/", json={"title": "Test Book", "author": "Test Author", "publication_year": 2022})` sends a POST request to add a new book.
- **Asserting Response:** After sending the request, the test function checks the response received from the server. This typically involves checking the status code of the response (`response.status_code`) and the data returned in the response body (`response.json()`).
- **Assertions:** Based on the expected behavior of the endpoint being tested, the test function contains assertions to ensure that the response received from the server matches the expected behavior. For example, in the `test_add_book` function, there are assertions to check if the response status code is 200 and if the returned JSON data matches the expected details of the added book.

**Purpose:** The purpose of the test client code is to automate the testing of the FastAPI application's endpoints. Each test function simulates a user interaction with the API endpoint and verifies that the endpoint behaves as expected. This helps ensure that the API endpoints function correctly and reliably under various conditions, helping maintain the quality and integrity of the application.
